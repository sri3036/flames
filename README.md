# flames
This is my first project I have tried.
We are all used to play a childhood game FLAMES for fun. We did it by using pen and paper but now the system will does.
This code helps to find an relationship between two persons.

How to run this code?
    use this command in ubuntu:-
         gcc flames_main.c flames_source.c 
         ./a.out
